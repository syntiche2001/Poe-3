Part 1: Command-Line Application

Clone or Download Repository:

Clone the GitHub repository containing the Recipe App source code to your local machine.
Alternatively, download the repository as a zip file and extract it to a local directory.
Open Solution in Visual Studio:

Navigate to the directory where you saved the repository.
Open the Visual Studio solution file (usually with a .sln extension) in Visual Studio.
Build Solution:

Once the solution is open, build the solution by clicking on the "Build" menu and selecting "Build Solution" or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + B.
Run the Application:

After the build is successful, locate the executable file or set the command-line application as the startup project.
Run the application by pressing F5 or clicking on the "Start" button in Visual Studio.
Follow On-Screen Instructions:

The command-line application should now be running. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the Recipe App, such as entering recipe details, scaling recipes, resetting quantities, clearing data, etc.
Part 2: Advanced C# Features

Follow the same steps as Part 1, but ensure you're working with the Part 2 tag in the repository to include the advanced features.

Portfolio of Evidence (PoE): Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)

For the PoE part, the instructions may vary based on the specifics of the WPF implementation and the chosen development environment. Here's a general outline:

Open Solution in Visual Studio:

Open the Visual Studio solution file containing the WPF project.
Build Solution:

Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are resolved and the project compiles without errors.
Run the Application:

Set the WPF project as the startup project.
Run the application by pressing F5 or clicking on the "Start" button in Visual Studio.
Interact with the GUI:

Once the application is running, interact with the graphical user interface to explore the features added in the PoE part.
Test the functionality, navigate through different screens (if any), and ensure that the application behaves as expected.
